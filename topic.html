                                <li>In simple terms, nest.js is an open source node.js framework built using typescript</li>
                                <li>for developing node.js server-side applications, which allows developers to cut loose complex configuration in backend development.</li>
                                <li>Nest.JS makes uses HTTP Server Frameworks such as Express. In addition to providing an abstraction layer over Express and Fastify,</li>
                                <li>Nest also makes their APIs available to developers directly. As a result, programmers are free to use any of the countless third-party modules that are accessible for the underlying platform.</li>

                    <h1>Importance of Nest.JS</h1>
                        <p class="middlecontent">
                            Owing to Nest.JS, Javascript has become the 'Lingua Franca' of the web for both front-end and backend applications. This has given rise to projects such as Angular, React<br>
                            and Vue, which improve developer productivity by making it possible to create fast, testable, and extensible frontend aplications.<br>
                            Eventhough many super libraries, helpers and tools exist for Node, none of these solve the main issue of Architecture.

                    <h1>Future Of Nest JS</h1>
                        <p> Nest is considered to be one of the most popular technology used in the industry. Nest is rapidly gaining popularity amoung developers thanks to its Modular Architechture and support for TypeScript. State of Javascript 
                            is a website that collects data from various type of developers to recognize current and upcoming trends.
                            According to the anual State of JavaScript report 2022, use of TypeScript is a very much popular trend in the devlopment field. Also the report depicts the growth in use of TypeScript in the past four years. TypeScript reamins as the most popular Javascript Flavor topping any other language such as CoffeeScript from a huge gap.
                            In the survey conducted by State of JavaScript website, Nest.JS is the 2nd most popular Framewokr for generating API's and mamaging back ends while the most popular Framework is Express.
                            Looking at these charts and and the popularity of TypeScript it could be predicted that Nest.JS would be very popular amoung developers in the future ahead.

                            Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime engine,
                            which provides developers ease to create network applications, while Nest.js is a framework that runs on Node.JS. It provides a collection of libraries and abstractions for developing server side applications 
                            in ease, both quickly and efficiently. Nest is developed on Node JS. it utilizes Express as its internal web framework.(by default)

                        The goal of Nest is to be a platform-agnostic framework<br>
                        Nest ia able to work with any  Node HTTP framework once an adapter is created.
